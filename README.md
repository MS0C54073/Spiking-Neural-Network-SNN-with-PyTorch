# Spiking-Neural-Network-SNN-with-PyTorch
Trained a model to make a comparison, without aiming to exceed any benchmarks. Note that the results are relatively similar, although the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) appears to exhibit slightly better performance, albeit with a longer training time.

Also the experiment clarifies that minimal hyperparameter tuning has been conducted thus far, as the code was written and shared in one go. Consequently, there is potential for significant performance variations with further adjustments. 

SNNs can serve as a regularization technique, akin to dropout, as the firing of neurons is not expected to occur simultaneously. Given the role of brain rhythms in the brain, which do not occur in traditional deep learning approaches.

Additionally, there is a possible connection between backpropagation and Hebbian learning in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), involving the incorporation of a time axis and refractory firing behavior.
